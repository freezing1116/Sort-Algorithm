## Download & Run
Make sure you have a C++ compiler (clang++ recommended) and basic shell access.  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/freezing1116/Sort-Algorithm
cd Sort-Algorithm
make
```

## How to Run Tests
Go to the `test_shell/` directory and run:

```bash
./test_contemporary_sort.sh
./test_bubble_sort.sh
./test_quick_sort.sh
# etc...
```

If the run has perfectly finished, you can now see reseults directory in which the results of test cases
